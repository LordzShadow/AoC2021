# Advent of Code 2021
Here are my solutions to this year's Advent of Code.  
Solved in Python
### Hardest so far: 
- Day 19
  - Couldn't figure out the solution, so used help from subreddit. Finally found the correct way to find overlapping beacons.
- Day 21
  - Second part took some time to get the recursion part right. (multiverse and stuff, complicated)
- Day 22
  - Mind was kinda exhausted already, again used help from the subreddit, but it makes so much sense now.
- Day 23
  - Not exactly hard but I had a bug that took forever to find
  - Also I started off doing recursion and oh boy that was not the way to go.
